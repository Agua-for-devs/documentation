# Welcome to Agua!

## What is Agua?

***



Agua is a **React Visual Environment**. If you hate working with large codebases and poor documentation, this is for you. You can use Agua to understand a React project faster. We also provide you with the best coding for any given task. **We want you to spend less time figuring out new code so you spend more time building amazing things.**

> Agua is **free** for developers!



## What can you do?

If you are new to a React project:

* You can [**select each element of your UI element and access its file**](basics/ui-picker.md) with just one click.
* You can **familiarize yourself with your codebase structure** with graph trees.
  * [**Component Graph**](./#dependencies-tree): Visuallice the DOM hierarchies
  * [**Dependencies Graph**](./#dependencies-tree): Visuallice the file's relationships&#x20;
